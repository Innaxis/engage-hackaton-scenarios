# Engage Hackaton scenarios

## How can I submit my answers?

* Once you have built a model to solve all the scenarios in the **scenarios/** folder, you can submit your answers.

* Remember that the answers have to be in **seconds**, not milliseconds.

* The first step is to fill the *seconds_to_threshold* column inside *predictions_YourTeamName.csv*.

* Once you have filled the file with the answers, edit the filename to replace *YourTeamName* with your team name. For example, if you team is called *Aviation Madrid*, the csv file with your predictions should be *predictions_AviationMadrid.csv*.

* Once you have it, you have to submit them by email. The subject of the email has to be "Final Predictions - Your Team Name" (for example "Final Predictions - Aviation Madrid") and you have to send the email to datahackathon@innaxis.aero

* In the email, you also have to provide all the code used to solve the scenarios: data processing scripts, model training pipelines and the model itself.

* Remember that the email has to arrive before 1pm (13:00) Spain local time.
